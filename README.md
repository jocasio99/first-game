# first-game
My first game using Godot, a simple 2D platformer. There are coins to collect a main menu, a pause menu, the ability to restart the game, and sound effects.

8/30/24 Update: Got the Jumping and the animations working.  Just need to get the Coin to work, there is an issue with the coin not recognizing it touching the player. So the coin cannot disappear and make a sound when it is collected. After figuring out the coin issue I want there to be 10 coins to collect, a sound effect for getting all 10 coins, a pause menu, respawning, lives, a game over screen, you win screen, and asking if the player wants to play again, and a restart game option. Potentially maybe a message regarding the plot, a timed mode after beating it the first time like to try to beat your time, and a web browser version.

9/30/24 Update: Finally got a chance to work on this again. I finally got the Coin to react to the player, play a sound once, and then disappear. Figuring out if I want a rolling camera like how the original Super Mario Bros had it or if the camera will be focused on the player the entire time. Here is a screenshot of it working: <br>
